# Getting Started with Snowpark for Machine Learning on SageMaker

## Overview

In this guide, we will perform data preperation and machine learning tasks to train a model to predict machine failure using Sagemaker, Snowpark for Python and scikit-learn. By the end of the session, you will have built a model in Sagemaker and deployed it to Snowflake.
